##*Hi, I'm Tommy*

###My two loves in life are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)'>Media</a>: its consumption, production, and distribution; and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet'>Internet</a>: for all the affordances it provides Digital Media.

###I work hard to help people be heard on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web'>the Web</a>.

###This is my voice: **Welcome!**
