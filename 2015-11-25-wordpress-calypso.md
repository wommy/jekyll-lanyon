so [wordpress](wordpress.com) came out with something new a day or two ago, [Calypso!](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/)

i was alerted to it because of my [twitter](twitter.com) [highlights](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/highlighting-the-best-of-twitter-for-you) had at least 10+ tweets that some how mentioned it. i started with [techcrunch's](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/23/wordpress-com-goes-open-source-and-gets-a-desktop-app/)

afterwards i formatted this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordPress?src=hash">#wordPress</a> rewrite&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/calypso?src=hash">#calypso</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rest?src=hash">#rest</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/api?src=hash">#api</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash">#javascript</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPA?src=hash">#SPA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openSource?src=hash">#openSource</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/github?src=hash">#github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/app?src=hash">#app</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mac?src=hash">#mac</a>&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web?src=hash">#web</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/design?src=hash">#design</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/development?src=hash">#development</a>&#10;<a href="https://t.co/jHxGih3T4N">https://t.co/jHxGih3T4N</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Williams (@Froggie92) <a href="https://twitter.com/Froggie92/status/669282177041850368">November 24, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">not looking forward to learning <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash">#wordpress</a>&#39;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/calypso?src=hash">#calypso</a>&#10;relevance =/= avoiding death &#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web?src=hash">#web</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/design?src=hash">#design</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/development?src=hash">#development</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Williams (@Froggie92) <a href="https://twitter.com/Froggie92/status/669284822087434240">November 24, 2015</a></blockquote>

if you could not tell, i still didnt know what it was about really, so i did a bunch more digging.

i went to [/r/wordpress](reddit.com/r/wordpress) (which i do not subscribe to) and opened up a bunch of tabs:

[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/3u34pc/thoughts_on_calypso/) & [original article](http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/11/thoughts-on-calypso/)

first, the reddit comments are bland. they congradulate [automattic](https://automattic.com/), wordpress's parent company.they emphasize the split between front end user interfaces and backend powered wordpress, which further gives weight has been the trend for a bit

this doesnt really say much. he talks about a wp-cli, which my workings in node has revealed the immense benefit of, but i already got that from the techcrunch article. Trac => Github + SVN => Git, cool. he brings up [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), which the techcrunch article does not mention, which only raises more questions. towards the bottom he really highlights this, mentioning all those misinformed tweets. 

when i saw javascript in the techcrunch article, i was happy. they even mentioned wordpress moving away from my two major annoyances, php and mysql!
