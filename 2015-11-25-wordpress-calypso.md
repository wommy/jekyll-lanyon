so [wordpress](wordpress.com) came out with something new a day or two ago, [Calypso!](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/)

i was alerted to it because of my [twitter](twitter.com) [highlights](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/highlighting-the-best-of-twitter-for-you) had at least 10+ tweets that some how mentioned it. i started with [techcrunch's](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/23/wordpress-com-goes-open-source-and-gets-a-desktop-app/)

afterwards i formatted this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordPress?src=hash">#wordPress</a> rewrite&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/calypso?src=hash">#calypso</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rest?src=hash">#rest</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/api?src=hash">#api</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash">#javascript</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPA?src=hash">#SPA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openSource?src=hash">#openSource</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/github?src=hash">#github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/app?src=hash">#app</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mac?src=hash">#mac</a>&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web?src=hash">#web</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/design?src=hash">#design</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/development?src=hash">#development</a>&#10;<a href="https://t.co/jHxGih3T4N">https://t.co/jHxGih3T4N</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Williams (@Froggie92) <a href="https://twitter.com/Froggie92/status/669282177041850368">November 24, 2015</a></blockquote>

i needed more information, so i went to reddit.

[this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/3u44aq/regarding_wordpress/) gave some structure to calypso, but only confused me more. off to google

[this venture beat article](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/24/wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg-breaks-down-the-blogging-platforms-biggest-overhaul-in-years/) interviews Matt Mullenweg, CEO of [Automattic](automattic.com), wordpress's parent company: they spent 20 months on redoing everything in javascript, but then clarifies that it was only the front end ui and that the back end is still all php; about wordpresses relevancy, more like hegemony; interviewer brings up rivals like [medium](https://medium.com/), which i personally enjoy; linux / windows support. overall blah article. 

afterwhich i fired off this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">not looking forward to learning <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash">#wordpress</a>&#39;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/calypso?src=hash">#calypso</a>&#10;relevance =/= avoiding death &#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web?src=hash">#web</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/design?src=hash">#design</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/development?src=hash">#development</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Williams (@Froggie92) <a href="https://twitter.com/Froggie92/status/669284822087434240">November 24, 2015</a></blockquote>

if you could not tell, i still didnt know what it was about really, so i did a bunch more digging.

[more reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3u3qoo/about_changes_on_wordpress/): admin ui change, got it already.

finally upon [/r/wordpress](reddit.com/r/wordpress) (which i do not subscribe to) and opened up a bunch of tabs:

[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/3u34pc/thoughts_on_calypso/) & [original article](http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/11/thoughts-on-calypso/)

first, the reddit comments are bland. they congradulate automattic, emphasizing the split between front end user interfaces and backend powered wordpress, which further gives weight to a trend that i've been seeing for a couple years now. wordpress's admin interface is a blessing and a curse: it set the stage for admin UIs but its lack of workflow customizability has spawned dozens of spinoffs that 'do it better', a strange spot to be in. hopefully this calypso really gives some power to areas that need it.

the actual article doesnt really say much. he talks about a wp-cli, which my workings in node has revealed the immense benefit of, but i already got that from the techcrunch article. Trac => Github + SVN => Git, cool. he brings up [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), which the techcrunch article does not mention, which only raises more questions. towards the bottom he really highlights this, mentioning all those misinformed tweets. 

when i saw javascript in the techcrunch article, i was happy. they even mentioned wordpress moving away from my two major annoyances, php and mysql! but this isnt the case.

finally upon'd [matt's own blog post about calypso and the update](http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/). starts with some finance; moves to sprawling codebase; drops that 25% of the web runs on wordpress; needing a huge improvement: 20x not 2x = CALYPSO: Node and React; 100% API-powered; social, responsive, authoring, multi-site managing, jetpack plugins, 100% open source. Sites linux release cycle; buncha explore links; reiterates that the 25% that use wordpress should be proud of open source; wraps with an infograph highlighting changes.

should have started with this one! finally a juicy artcle! okay so some critical anaylsis:
