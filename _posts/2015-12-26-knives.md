earl recommended a subreddit to me, called [everday carry, EDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/)

i guessed it refered to contents of your pockets, something im interested in, but i now know its about the knife carrying lifestyle.

in the sidebar it had many cool topics ranging from the actual contents of your pockets, to the contents of your backpack, to the gun you carry everyday.

this post pretty much serves to annotate my findings, specifically on knife martial arts.
