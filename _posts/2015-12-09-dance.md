so i kinda dove into jackin house today

it started with [heidi's boiler room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUCtuXvk_Vc).

thirdish song in is [sante: we came(to jack)](https://soundcloud.com/sante/sante-we-came-to-jack-original-mixvivamusic)

stroble just told me the other day about jackin house, which i mislabeled as booty. so i [wikipedia'd it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacking)

[house dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dance) has its own wikipedia entry.

i guess the jack is actually a [dance move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaftuBfkGj8)?
